## How to publish with GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository named:

```text
jinho-korean-tutor
```

2. Upload these files to the repository root:

```text
index.html
style.css
data.js
app.js
README.md
```

3. Go to:

```text
Settings → Pages
```

4. Set:

```text
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: main
Folder: /root
```

5. Click Save.

6. After a few minutes, open:

```text
https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/jinho-korean-tutor/
```

Example:

```text
https://ilpyo81.github.io/jinho-korean-tutor/
```

## Notes about microphone

Voice recognition and recording usually require HTTPS.

GitHub Pages gives you an HTTPS address, so microphone features should work better than opening the file directly from Android `content://`.

The Voice Score feature is not true phoneme-level pronunciation scoring. It uses browser speech recognition and compares the recognized Korean text with the target sentence. For advanced pronunciation scoring, a server-side speech model or pronunciation API would be needed.

## Updating content later

Most phrase and story updates can be made in:

```text
data.js
```

You usually do not need to change `index.html`, `style.css`, or `app.js` for simple story updates.
